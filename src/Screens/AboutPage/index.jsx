              <span style={{fontSize:"33px",color:"#DE3163"}}>The perfume</span> of petrichor is distilled into miniature glass vials at Kannauj, a small town on the banks of river Ganga that has been guarding the secret of traditional Indian perfumes for centuries.
              The fragrant credentials of this city, known as the <span style={{fontSize:"23px",color:"#DE3163"}}>‘Grasse of the East’</span> and <span style={{fontSize:"23px",color:"#DE3163"}}>‘India’s Perfume Capital’,</span> are age old. Situated on the historical scent trade route that brought perfumes from India to the Middle East, Kannauj’s perfumeries were famed for their magnificent attars. The perfumers of Kannauj also made the scented oils Mughal Emperors were so immensely fond of.
              Sometime in the past, the legendary perfumers of ancient Kannauj Pt. Babulal Sharma created a unique scent that would capture the fragrance of earth when first touched by the monsoon rains. Extracted from parched clay and distilled with ancient techniques, it is today known as mitti attar – Earth’s perfume. It is also called itr-e-khaki.<span style={{fontSize:"23px",color:"#DE3163"}}> We made attar even today in Kannauj’s traditional perfumeries,</span> where sinewy craftsmen tend to fires under ageing copper cauldrons or degs to make this remarkable perfume. The distillation process, called deg bhapka, is painstakingly slow and long, with no trace of industrial machinery or modernity.
